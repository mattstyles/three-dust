```

## Contributing
In lieu of a formal styleguide, take care to maintain the existing coding style. Add unit tests for any new or changed functionality. Lint and test your code using [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/).

_Also, please don't edit files in the "dist" subdirectory as they are generated via Grunt. You'll find source code in the "lib" subdirectory!_

## Notes
Scaffolded with `yo threejs` but then changed a little to support additional modules and commonjs style, see `main.js`.

It actually started out life as a port of [pixi-dust](https://github.com/mattstyles/pixi-dust) but has already outgrown it’s roots.
